# Auto Read.me Generator

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

For this project I created a Readme Generator only using Jscript. The purpose for this project, is to save time for me or any other developer that is creating a project. This will generate a proper and high quality Readme, it uses the same syntax as "Professional README Guide" found down below in the resources section.
